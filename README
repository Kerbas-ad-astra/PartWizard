1. Features

* Provides a list of parts with part highlighting for easier identification.
* Allows deleting of parts from the list on eligible[1] parts.
* Allows "breaking" of symmetry[2] on eligible[3] parts.
* Shows either all parts or only those that are hidden from the editor's Parts List.

[1] Parts eligible for deleting via Part Wizard are those that are not the "root" part and have no attached parts.
[2] Symmetry is broken on the designated part, its counter parts and all symmetrical child parts.
[3] Parts eligible for "breaking" of symmetry must not include the "root" part as a counterpart or as a child part. 

2. Requirements

blizzy78's Toolbar plugin is required in order to show the Part Wizard interface. The plugin is NOT included with Part Wizard and must be downloaded separately: http://blizzy.de/toolbar/download.html See the official Kerbal Space Program forum thread for more information: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863-0-23-5-Toolbar-1-7-1-Common-API-for-draggable-resizable-buttons-toolbar

3. Installation

    1. Place the PartWizard folder in to your Kerbal Space Program installation under the GameData folder.
	
4. Usage

The Part Wizard toolbar icon is only available in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) or Space Plane Hangar (SPH) editors. The first time you start Kerbal Space Program with the Part Wizard plugin installed, you will need to configure your toolbar to display the Part Wizard icon. Once configured, clicking the Part Wizard toolbar icon will show Part Wizard, and clicking the toolbar icon again will hide it.

    a. Part List Overview

	The Part Wizard interface presents a list of parts that currently make up your vehicle. Mousing over each part on the list will highlight the part within the editor. At the bottom of the window is a status area that always shows the current total part count and, when mousing over a part, will show that part's internal name.

	b. View Mode

	There are two buttons at the top of the interface, "All" and "Hidden". These buttons control the current viewing mode, which is indicated by depressed button with green text. "All" mode shows all of the current parts in the list. "Hidden" mode shows only those parts that have been hidden from the Parts List, as designated by the either the part's configuration (.cfg) file or as modified by the Module Manager [1] plugin (or similar). Hidden mode is intended to allow the easy locating of parts that may have been made obsolete by the author.

	c. Deleting Parts

	Each active part in the Part Wizard list has a small button (labelled with a "X"). When this button is enabled, a part may be deleted by clicking the associated "X" button. The part will be removed immediately. If the part intended for deletion is symmetrical with other parts, ALL of its counterparts will also be deleted. (If this is not intended, see Breaking Symmetry, below.)

	d. Breaking Symmetry

	Each active part in the Part Wizard list has a small button (labelled with a "B"). When this button is enabled, a part's symmetry may be broken by clicking the associated "B" button. The part, all of its counterparts, and all symmetrical child parts will be converted to non-symmetrical parts and can then be manipulated as individual parts. When the Break Symmetry feature is not available for a part, it is likely that the part or one of its related parts has been made the "root" part in some way. Note that non-symmetrical child parts are ignored by the Break Symmetry feature and will not be modified.

	e. Undoing an Operation

	Part Wizard utilizes the editor to enable its features and as such, its operations are undoable as normal. However, it may require more than one "undo" action to completely revert the actions due to the operations Part Wizard performs, especially when breaking symmetry.
